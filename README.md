# AI-Driven EV Charging Network Optimization Platform

## 🚀 Introduction
Electric vehicles (EVs) are at the core of India's sustainable mobility transition. However, inefficient charging infrastructure hinders large-scale adoption. This project presents an **AI-driven Charging Network Optimization Platform** that utilizes predictive analytics, dynamic pricing, and smart load balancing to optimize EV charging networks in India.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **🔍 Demand Prediction:** AI-based forecasting of peak charging times using ARIMA and deep learning models.
- **📍 Optimized Station Placement:** Data-driven insights for optimal charging station locations.
- **⏳ Dynamic Pricing:** Real-time pricing adjustments based on demand fluctuations.
- **🛣 Route Optimization:** AI-driven EV route planning and station recommendations.
- **📊 Smart Load Balancing:** Grid optimization using IoT-enabled charging stations.
- **📡 API & Mobile Integration:** Real-time station availability, reservations, and analytics.

## 📌 Problem Statement
EV adoption is growing (30% CAGR), but challenges remain:
- 🚧 **Uneven charging station distribution** (rural areas underserved).
- ⚡ **Grid Overload** (charging during peak hours strains grids).
- 💰 **High Operational Costs** (inefficiencies in energy procurement & maintenance).
- 🔋 **Range Anxiety** (67% of buyers cite lack of infrastructure as a deterrent).
- 📉 **Fragmented Solutions** (existing platforms lack predictive analytics & pricing models).

## 🔥 AI-Powered Solution
- **🔗 IoT-Enabled Smart Charging Stations** for real-time data monitoring.
- **📈 Machine Learning Models** (ARIMA, LSTMs) for demand forecasting.
- **☁️ Cloud-Based Infrastructure** (AWS, Azure) for real-time analytics.
- **⚡ Renewable Energy Integration** for sustainable charging.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python (Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ARIMA, StatsModels)
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS / Azure
- **IoT Integration:** MQTT, Node.js, Raspberry Pi
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **API Integration:** Google Maps API for route optimization
- **Mobile App:** React Native (for real-time station tracking & reservations)

## 🏗 Prototype Development
### Demand Forecasting Example (ARIMA Model)
```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Load historical charging demand data
data = pd.read_csv('charging_demand.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')

# Train ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data['Demand'], order=(1,1,1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast demand for next 30 days
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=30)
print("Next 30-Day Demand Forecast:\n", forecast)
```
**Sample Output:**
```
Date           Forecasted Demand (kWh)
2025-01-01     4500
2025-01-02     4670
...
2025-01-30     5200
```

## 💰 Business Model
